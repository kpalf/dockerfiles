Anyone is free to use and modify these Dockerfiles. They are provided as-is and without warranty or support. They do not constitute part of the Software AG product suite, nor any part of the formal Apama Community assets provided by Software AG. Users are free to use, fork and modify them.

However, the content of the images produced by any Dockerfile will be subject to the license of the original components that are being packaged.
For example, where Apama Core Community Edition files are packaged into an image these are subject to the Apama Community legal Terms and Conditions: http://www.apamacommunity.com/terms-conditions/
That link will normally be presenting the Software AG general license, and the primary difference from the commercial version is highlighted in "PART F: PRODUCT SPECIFIC TERMS for Apama Core Community Edition":
